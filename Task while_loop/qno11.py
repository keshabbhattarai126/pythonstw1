# 11. Write a Python program that prompts the user to repeatedly enter a name. 
# If the user enters the phrase "good luck," the program keeps track of how many 
# times the phrase has been entered. When the phrase has been entered three times, 
# the program should display a message stating "You typed good luck three times." 
# For each entry of "good luck" before the third occurrence, display the message 
# "You typed the same word [count] times." Continue this process until the phrase 
# has been entered three times.

while count < 3:
    name = input("Enter a name (or type 'good luck'): ")
    
    if name == "good luck":
        count += 1
        if count == 3:
            print("You typed good luck three times.")
